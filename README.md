## NudeNet API
NudeNet is a collection of Pre-trainer classification and detection models for nudity detection and censoring. This tool will allow you to do 3 different things:
    >classify: identify with a percentage if the processed image is safe for anyone. The higher the unsafe property value, the higher the probability for the image to contain adult content.
    detection: after the classification, you may want to provide a description of what's exposed in the image (parts of the body).
    censoring: provide the censored version of the provided image.
